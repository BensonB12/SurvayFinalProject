# This language
1. TypeScript was created because of how limiting JavaScript seemed to be when you 
scaled everything up. That we wanted a new language that can be interprited by 
browsers that wasn't just JavaScript
2. TypeScript is really turning up everywhere. It specifically is in web developement 
beacause, again, it was made to challenge javascript. But it is in financial applications,
server-side developement, mobile app and more.
3. There is a big learning curvef or TypeScript, that it takes a lot to understand and
fully grasp before you understand it really well. It also has a building step where you
parse it into JavaScript.

# functional example
1. I was trying to solve the problem of calling the API. I figured that if I could just make one function that does one call to the API, I no longer need to worry about calling the API.
2. functional programming lead me to choose it by the desire of only wanting to deal with awaiting and so forth once.
3. I could have also taken the stack based approach and called it evertime something wanted anything from the API.
4. I only had to call the API once, but looking back it was a pretty big function.
# object-oriented
1. I made an object that contains everthing a card has from the API.
2. I wanted to store a complex item, and there is no better way to do it.
3. I could have used an array base solution and just stored everything in an array, but that would have been hard to understand.
4. The pros where that I could communicate complicated things to my API, but the downside is that it took some research and trust in something else (the API) that I couldn't control. 
# stack-based 
1. The problem I had to solve was how to access everthing I needed for my big method. 
2. The stack-based approach made it seem like I just needed to put everhting I needed on the stack and then I could individually pop them when I needed them.
3. I could have used an array to store everthing, but it would have been more complicated.
4. The pros was that everthing was accounted for when I was ready, the cons was that I had a lot to set up at the start.
# array-based programming
1. The problem I had was I needed to keep ahold of certain objects that where very similar, but they also would be varying lengths. 
2. The best way to group simple things together is through arrays if you ask me.
3. I could have used an object that holds multiple colors, but varying lengths is more tricky in a complex object, and that is not needed.
4. The pros where that I had easy assess to them in my method I used, the cons where that they all had to be one specific type, so I couldn't put colors with numbers. 
# Another functional example
1. I needed to do something over and over again, and it was becoming tedius. 
2. The way to cut out duplicate code is through functions.
3. I could have done a stack based approach where held everthing together and then figured them all out down the stack, but that seemed too complicated for a simple solution.
4. The pros where my code was neater, but the cons was I had to then still call the method over and over agian.

# Connections
This was the second language I felt that had a ton of modules and extentions, and spin offs, which reminded me a lot of python and how it needed a lot more work than just one download.
The other laungage it reminded me of was f# and slightly more of python because of its sintax. 
It also dragged me into JavaScript so it reminded me of that too.
